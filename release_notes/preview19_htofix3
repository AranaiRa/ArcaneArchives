***Known issues***

:task_incomplete: Recharge-over-time gems still make you wave your hand frantically.
:task_incomplete: The Brazier's fire is still suck-y.
:task_incomplete: The current fluid is not currently rendered onto the icon for the Radiant Amphora regardless of mode.
:task_incomplete: Despite my best efforts, chest names and display stacks on Radiant Chests may still disappear.
:task_incomplete: Crafting odd recipes like mushroom step with multiple ingredients in the crafting grid may result in the output not being updated on the client side. If you keep clicking you will get the result though.
:task_incomplete: Slivers of light do weird things when stuffed into a Lantnern of Paranoia from Reliquary; likewise there are weird placement issues and weird dropping-off-when-neighbour-changed.
:task_incomplete: GUI scale can be an issue for larger resolutions with the Tome of Arcana.

***Changes***
:task_complete: There's a new debug command called `/tiles`! It's mostly to provide debugging information about what tiles are registered on your network, but it has the handy side-effect of adding every tile location to your tracking.
:task_complete: The code has been significantly reorganised and tidied because I felt like it.
:task_complete: The code for collating Manifest items no longer discards the first stack of every item, meaning that your items no longer randomly disapepar!
:task_complete: The tooltips of upgraded tanks should now correctly show their actual capacity, using the new capacity calculation.
:task_complete: In addition, the TEISR no longer uses the incorrect capacity resulting in "longboi" tank renderers. Sorry, but that was actually a bug!
:task_complete: ***The radiant tank TEISR now renders correctly in your inventory regardless of whether or not you are holding it or another tank!*** Hallelujah! Potentially this resolves all issues involving GL state leaks with Arcane Archives code.
:task_complete: GCT Recipes that are provided with an ItemStack now correctly search for the recipe that creates that ItemStack, rather than searching for a recipe with the same registry name as the item.
