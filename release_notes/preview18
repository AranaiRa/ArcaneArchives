***Known issues***
:task_incomplete: Recharge-over-time gems still make you wave your hand frantically.
:task_incomplete: The Brazier's maximum range and range interface are not yet implemented.
:task_incomplete: The Brazier's fire is still suck-y.
:task_incomplete: Manifest packet sizes for large Hive networks are potentially too large and will cause the server to crash.
:task_incomplete: Translocators might now work with Troves but this seems unlikely.
:task_incomplete: The Radiant Tank TEISR is still funky.
:task_incomplete: The current fluid is not currently rendered onto the icon for the Radiant Amphora regardless of mode.
:task_incomplete: Despite my best efforts, chest names and display stacks on Radiant Chests may still disappear.
:task_incomplete: Crafting odd recipes like mushroom step with multiple ingredients in the crafting grid may result in the output not being updated on the client side. If you keep clicking you will get the result though.
:task_incomplete: ***Tooltips for tanks are completely wrong*** when it comes to maximum capacity.
:task_incomplete: Slivers of light do weird things when stuffed into a Lantnern of Paranoia from Reliquary; likewise there are weird placement issues and weird dropping-off-when-neighbour-changed.
:task_incomplete: GUI scale can be an issue for larger resolutions with the Tome of Arcana.

***Changes***
:task_complete: There's now a home page to the Tome of Arcana, with beautiful hoveing things!
:task_complete: Munchstone configuration is now more efficient and has default compatibility with Roots, Mystical World, Rustic, and others!
:task_complete: The Parchtear now replaces fluid blocks with blocks that hold back additional fluid, which decays after 10 seconds.
:task_complete: The Gem Cutter's Table's initial recipe is now craftable without having to change the recipe and then changing back.
:task_complete: Double-right-click into the brazier now works for the item you double-clicked, even if it results in an empty slot in your hand; sneak-double-right-click will now attempt to dump your entire inventory (besides hotbar).
:task_complete: Troves with a voiding upgrade will now be prioritised as a Brazier target above anything else.
:task_complete: Brazier routing is technically implemented: you can specify chests that accept new items or that only accept items that they already contain.
:task_complete: Gem Cutter's Table is now a target for the Brazier but only for items already contained and only up to the maximum stack size of that item.
:task_complete: Flint & Steel-using recipes now consume durability rather than consuming the entire thing.
:task_complete: Gem Cutter's Table accessors and the Lectern Manifest's accessors have now been completely rewritten so they're fine.
:task_complete: There are now fun advancements to achieve and progress through the game with!
:task_complete: Pressing "E" no longer closes the Radiant Chest interface while renaming; in addition, changes have been made that will hopefully allow display stacks and chest names to persist.
:task_complete: Favourite-tagged (by Quark) items will not be accepted by the brazier.
:task_complete: West-facing Radiant Lanterns no longer look poopy.
:task_complete: The gem charge bar now has a minimum width of 1px, meaning it will no longer look as though it's empty when it's not empty.
:task_complete: Shift-clicking now works for moving upgrades into Radiant Tanks.
:task_complete: Guidebook changes! Tome changes! My brain is no longer functional!
:task_complete: The Brazier can now have items piped into it by hoppers, pipes, etc. In addition, sneak-right-click with Thermal Foundation/CoFH satchels now dumps the contents into the brazier rather than depositing the satchel.
:task_complete: Troves now display their full inventory when queried by capabilities.
:task_complete: Gem Cutter's Table slots now have colouring to them. In addition, the colouring is now using the same system as the tracking lines.
:task_complete: You can now use the Manifest to track items in Radiant Crafting Tables.
:task_complete: You can now optionally configure the Manifest to synchronise with JEI. 
:task_complete: The Manifest can now accept "@" before a term to search through the mod name and mod ID. In addition, you can use "!" before a term to search through the tooltip. Note: ***this is completely untested and I only just remembered about it and it'll probably be broken***.
:task_complete: The Gem Socket now has proper shift-clicking. Likewise the Devouring Charm. They prioritise the hotbar when transferring into the player inventory.
:task_complete: You can now place a Radiant Amphora into a dispenser. When activated it will try to collect a fluid block in front of it or, if one doesn't exist, it will try to place a fluid from the linked container. It won't absorb liquids that don't match its current tank's contents.
:task_complete: Gems now automatically attempt to recharge when they reach the charge of 0, regardless of where they are. In addition, there is now a button in the gem socket UI that attempts to recharge all held gems or socketed gems. They will also attempt to recharge with powder.
:task_complete: Dhi Bugh's Sphere of ... something can now be used to debug weirdness in networks and potentially crash your server and/or client.
:task_complete: The Manifest can now be sorted alphabetically or by quantity, in ascending or descending order. 
:task_complete: Compatibility with other mods is now listed in the Tome of Arcana.
:task_complete: The Radiant Amphora works properly again!

***Testing targets***
:task_bullet: Every single thing mentioned above.
