***Known issues***
:task_complete: Arcane Archives now depends on Mystical Lib in addition to Baubles. They are included in the zip file.
:task_incomplete: The Devouring Charm will now try to place fluid containers in the fluid slot, but may return them automatically to you. Closing the interface and opening your inventory should fix any desyncs.
:task_incomplete: You can currently no longer use the Scepter of Manipulation to remove upgrades from tanks & troves. A new interface to do this is coming.
:task_incomplete: The book granted from breaking a bookcase or crafting your first resonator may not function correctly as a Tome of Arcana (meaning that you cannot open it).
:task_incomplete: The recipes for various Scepters and other items in JEI display "4" and "6" as quantities for items even though it is for standard crafting tables. (This is actually an issue in the recipe itself for some reason.)

***Changes***
:task_complete: Radiant Tanks used as items to transfer fluids now properly transfer the correct amount.
:task_complete: Cleansegleams can now properly be recharged by milk buckets even though I didn't test this.
:task_complete: All Arcane Gems now have tooltips telling you how they are recharged.
:task_complete: There's now Thaumcraft compatibility: Braziers and Raw Crystal Clusters (those grown & those collected via silk touch) act as infusion stabilisers, while all other objects have aspects.
:task_complete: Breaking a Radiant Chest with more than 64 of a single stack will no longer void the excess.
:task_complete: Mountaintears should now properly be rechargeable (and not destroyed by) in lava.
