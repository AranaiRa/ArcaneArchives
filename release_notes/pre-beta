@everyone The Arcane Archives ***pre-beta*** for 0.2.0 is now available in #alpha-builds. This is a significant advancement over our previous *preview* builds and is almost entirely feature complete. There will be ~~blood~~ bugs!

***How you can help***: we want to push hard to find & fix bugs before release. So please download the mod, include it in your packs, and test it out as best you can!

We want all feedback, even if you think it might be already reported. For complex issues (involving crash reports), please post to GitHub: https://github.com/AranaiRa/ArcaneArchives/issues

For all other issues, post to #bug-reports.

***You can also play with us*** on the Arcane Archives server which will soon be updated to `0.2.0-pre-beta1`. The server is open to anyone! Check out #server-updates for more information.
