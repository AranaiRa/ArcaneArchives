***Known issues***
:task_incomplete: The Radiant Amphora still does not have fluid cutout textures. If you know how these things work, please give me a yell!
:task_incomplete: Chest names and display-stack issues potentially related to the Great Inventory Desync Of '19 have hopefully been resolved. There may be lingering issues -- please report these if they occur.
:task_complete: Radiant Slivers of Light no longer require support and will no longer drop off when you break the block supporting them. This is not the ideal solution, but it does solve most bugs associated with them.

***Changes***
:task_complete: The config option for JEI Synchronisation between the Manifest now sets the "default" state. You can otherwise toggle JEI synchronisation using a new button on the manifest.
:task_complete: Your previous JEI search term (if not blank) is restored to JEI when closing the manifest.
:task_complete: GCT recipes have been centered properly in the Tome of Arcana, and will now hopefully never fail to resolve to their correct recipe.
:task_complete: The new Manifest system should no longer prevent single-stack items & the first stacks in groups of items from showing up. 
:task_complete: The Radiant Crafting Table's output slot now updates correctly every time a new craft is made, instead of every second time.
:task_complete: The Radiant Sliver has been changed to mimic the Radiant Lantern.
:task_complete: Brazier priority for empty chests has been reduced slightly.:task_complete: The Devouring Charm can now be used as a method of automatically voiding things when you pick them up: clicking the button in the interface will switch to the "back" side, where you can store "ghost" images of specific items. *Note: It is not currently possible to drag items from JEI into these slots.* Encountering any item on the ground that matches something in the back slots will result in the item being voided.
:task_complete: Troves now keep their contents when broken and can be re-placed anywhere in the world. If you wish to completely break a trove and spill its items everywhere, you can use a scepter (of Manipulation or Revelation) to do so; these scepters have greater efficiency against Troves.
:task_complete: ***The Great Inventory Desync Of '19 has been resolved***! Rejoice! It stems entirely from me failing to understand how code works and then failing to realise after scrolling up and down the file forever. But it's fixed! Hopefully.
:task_complete: Chest and display item serialisation between server & client has been improved, hopefully to the point where names and item stacks will no longer disappear.
:task_complete: It's now possible to "store" favourite recipes in the Radiant Crafting Table! The three vertical slots on the right hand side can be hoever over when empty to see the current item in the crafting table, or you can press shift to see the most recently crafted item.
:task_complete: Clicking or shift-clicking on one of these empty slots will result in the recipe output being store there. Shift-clicking on an already filled slot will remove the recipe.
:task_complete: Clicking (without holding shift) on one of these recipe slots with sufficient materials in your inventory (or in the crafting grid) will instantly craft that item and place it in your inventory.
:task_complete: Empty slots no longer show up in the Manifest when filtering by name or item.
:task_complete: Rejoice! The Brazier of Hoarding's fire is now being rendered in glorious fullbright. 


***Testing targets***
:task_bullet: Everything you possible can!
:task_bullet: Using the Trove as an inventory as an item.
:task_bullet: Checking to make sure the manifest reports item quantities correctly in all cases.
:task_bullet: Checking to make sure the brazier delivers everything to the correct place.
:task_bullet: Ensuring that the desync HAS gone away.
:task_bullet: Ensuring that chest names and chest display items don't disappear.
