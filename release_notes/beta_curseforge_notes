:task_complete: There's now a home page to the Tome of Arcana, with beautiful hoveing things!
:task_complete: Munchstone configuration is now more efficient and has default compatibility with Roots, Mystical World, Rustic, and others!
:task_complete: The Parchtear now replaces fluid blocks with blocks that hold back additional fluid, which decays after 10 seconds.
:task_complete: The Gem Cutter's Table's initial recipe is now craftable without having to change the recipe and then changing back.
:task_complete: Double-right-click into the brazier now works for the item you double-clicked, even if it results in an empty slot in your hand; sneak-double-right-click will now attempt to dump your entire inventory (besides hotbar).
:task_complete: Troves with a voiding upgrade will now be prioritised as a Brazier target above anything else.
:task_complete: Brazier routing is technically implemented: you can specify chests that accept new items or that only accept items that they already contain.
:task_complete: Gem Cutter's Table is now a target for the Brazier but only for items already contained and only up to the maximum stack size of that item.
:task_complete: Flint & Steel-using recipes now consume durability rather than consuming the entire thing.
:task_complete: Gem Cutter's Table accessors and the Lectern Manifest's accessors have now been completely rewritten so they're fine.
:task_complete: There are now fun advancements to achieve and progress through the game with!
:task_complete: Pressing "E" no longer closes the Radiant Chest interface while renaming; in addition, changes have been made that will hopefully allow display stacks and chest names to persist.
:task_complete: Favourite-tagged (by Quark) items will not be accepted by the brazier.
:task_complete: West-facing Radiant Lanterns no longer look poopy.
:task_complete: The gem charge bar now has a minimum width of 1px, meaning it will no longer look as though it's empty when it's not empty.
:task_complete: Shift-clicking now works for moving upgrades into Radiant Tanks.
:task_complete: Guidebook changes! Tome changes! My brain is no longer functional!
:task_complete: The Brazier can now have items piped into it by hoppers, pipes, etc. In addition, sneak-right-click with Thermal Foundation/CoFH satchels now dumps the contents into the brazier rather than depositing the satchel.
:task_complete: Troves now display their full inventory when queried by capabilities.
:task_complete: Gem Cutter's Table slots now have colouring to them. In addition, the colouring is now using the same system as the tracking lines.
:task_complete: You can now use the Manifest to track items in Radiant Crafting Tables.
:task_complete: You can now optionally configure the Manifest to synchronise with JEI. 
:task_complete: The Manifest can now accept "@" before a term to search through the mod name and mod ID. In addition, you can use "!" before a term to search through the tooltip. Note: ***this is completely untested and I only just remembered about it and it'll probably be broken***.
:task_complete: The Gem Socket now has proper shift-clicking. Likewise the Devouring Charm. They prioritise the hotbar when transferring into the player inventory.
:task_complete: You can now place a Radiant Amphora into a dispenser. When activated it will try to collect a fluid block in front of it or, if one doesn't exist, it will try to place a fluid from the linked container. It won't absorb liquids that don't match its current tank's contents.
:task_complete: Gems now automatically attempt to recharge when they reach the charge of 0, regardless of where they are. In addition, there is now a button in the gem socket UI that attempts to recharge all held gems or socketed gems. They will also attempt to recharge with powder.
:task_complete: Dhi Bugh's Sphere of ... something can now be used to debug weirdness in networks and potentially crash your server and/or client.
:task_complete: The Manifest can now be sorted alphabetically or by quantity, in ascending or descending order. 
:task_complete: Compatibility with other mods is now listed in the Tome of Arcana.
:task_complete: The Radiant Amphora works properly again!
:task_complete: The Debug Orb (default crafting recipe is shapeless, 1 glass -> debug orb) will allow you to gather information from the clietn & server side about troves, tanks and chests.
:task_complete: Tooltip searching for the Manifest was removed as a flawed and failed process that violated Client/Server sanctity.
:task_complete: Client/Server cross-over crash from recharging gems was fixed.
:task_complete: The Brazier-toggle for Radiant Chests is less susceptible to null pointer errors.
:task_complete: Gem recharge messages now use the proper translation key.
:task_complete: The Debug Orb can be used to fill a Radiant Trove with snowballs by sneak-right-clicking.
:task_complete: Tiles re-entering the network will have their tile list entry refreshed, updating any potentially invalid weak references.
:task_complete: Requesting a manifest update will result in the entire network having its references validated and remade if the tile entities are within loaded areas. These two changes should mean that troves and chests will no longer disappear off networks.
:task_complete: Double-clicking an item into a brazier should no longer deposit every copy in your inventory for every time it appears in your inventory, i.e., no more random duplication.
:task_complete: The Radiant Amphora should no longer cause a null-pointer error if its capability returns null.
:task_complete: Immanence Tile Entities now transmit their new tile ID to the client when they gain one, instead of being without one on the client side until a restart or a reload.
:task_complete: There is a new config option that allows you to set newly placed chests with the "No New Stacks" option set by default.
:task_complete: Scepters of Revelation and Manipulation, as well as the Debug Orb, are no longer accepted by the brazier.
:task_complete: The Copy command used for the debug orb's testing and transmitting URL functionality now requires a permission level of 0, i.e., anyone can uses it.
:task_complete: Brazier routing has been completely rewritten. Voiding troves are prioritised above all else, with voiding troves that aren't full prioritised over those that are; Gem Cutter's Tables with stacks of the relevant item will have that stack filled; otherwise troves with the item will be prioritised over chests, and the weight of a chest is determine by the percentage of slots containing the item (multiplied by 2) plus the number of empty slots. 
:task_complete: If you have any issues with brazier routing or any confusion, please use the `/brazier` command to get a debug output.
:task_complete: It's now possible to throw the Mountaintear.
:task_complete: The maximum slot size for a single item in a Radiant Chest is now 4, instead of 8. ***This may cause you to lose items if you had more than 4 in a chest***.
:task_complete: Chromatic powders now have aspects.
:task_complete: The Brazier interface (accessed via the scepter of manipulation) now allows you to limit the brazier to your subnetwork (instead of depositing to all attached chests in your hive), and now allows you to specify a range.
:task_complete: Brazier ranges are limited to a maximum of 300 blocks (radius), within the same dimension. You can press the eye button to toggle a visual of the range (thanks to EnderCore & EnderIO).
:task_complete: Rewrote Manifest code to use ByteBufs properly instead of just trying to serialise a complete NBT Tag Compound. It now properly separates out items that are further than your maximum distance, even if you have the same item in your network.
:task_complete: There's a new debug command called `/tiles`! It's mostly to provide debugging information about what tiles are registered on your network, but it has the handy side-effect of adding every tile location to your tracking.
:task_complete: The code has been significantly reorganised and tidied because I felt like it.
:task_complete: The code for collating Manifest items no longer discards the first stack of every item, meaning that your items no longer randomly disapepar!
:task_complete: The tooltips of upgraded tanks should now correctly show their actual capacity, using the new capacity calculation.
:task_complete: In addition, the TEISR no longer uses the incorrect capacity resulting in "longboi" tank renderers. Sorry, but that was actually a bug!
:task_complete: ***The radiant tank TEISR now renders correctly in your inventory regardless of whether or not you are holding it or another tank!*** Hallelujah! Potentially this resolves all issues involving GL state leaks with Arcane Archives code.
:task_complete: GCT Recipes that are provided with an ItemStack now correctly search for the recipe that creates that ItemStack, rather than searching for a recipe with the same registry name as the item.
:task_complete: The config option for JEI Synchronisation between the Manifest now sets the "default" state. You can otherwise toggle JEI synchronisation using a new button on the manifest.
:task_complete: Your previous JEI search term (if not blank) is restored to JEI when closing the manifest.
:task_complete: GCT recipes have been centered properly in the Tome of Arcana, and will now hopefully never fail to resolve to their correct recipe.
:task_complete: The new Manifest system should no longer prevent single-stack items & the first stacks in groups of items from showing up. 
:task_complete: The Radiant Crafting Table's output slot now updates correctly every time a new craft is made, instead of every second time.
:task_complete: The Radiant Sliver has been changed to mimic the Radiant Lantern.
:task_complete: Brazier priority for empty chests has been reduced slightly.:task_complete: The Devouring Charm can now be used as a method of automatically voiding things when you pick them up: clicking the button in the interface will switch to the "back" side, where you can store "ghost" images of specific items. *Note: It is not currently possible to drag items from JEI into these slots.* Encountering any item on the ground that matches something in the back slots will result in the item being voided.
:task_complete: Troves now keep their contents when broken and can be re-placed anywhere in the world. If you wish to completely break a trove and spill its items everywhere, you can use a scepter (of Manipulation or Revelation) to do so; these scepters have greater efficiency against Troves.
:task_complete: ***The Great Inventory Desync Of '19 has been resolved***! Rejoice! It stems entirely from me failing to understand how code works and then failing to realise after scrolling up and down the file forever. But it's fixed! Hopefully.
:task_complete: Chest and display item serialisation between server & client has been improved, hopefully to the point where names and item stacks will no longer disappear.
:task_complete: It's now possible to "store" favourite recipes in the Radiant Crafting Table! The three vertical slots on the right hand side can be hoever over when empty to see the current item in the crafting table, or you can press shift to see the most recently crafted item.
:task_complete: Clicking or shift-clicking on one of these empty slots will result in the recipe output being store there. Shift-clicking on an already filled slot will remove the recipe.
:task_complete: Clicking (without holding shift) on one of these recipe slots with sufficient materials in your inventory (or in the crafting grid) will instantly craft that item and place it in your inventory.
:task_complete: Empty slots no longer show up in the Manifest when filtering by name or item.
:task_complete: Rejoice! The Brazier of Hoarding's fire is now being rendered in glorious fullbright. 
:task_complete: Size adjustment for the brazier range is now documented.
:task_complete: Right-clicking a petal apothecary with a rivertear anywhere in your inventory will attempt to refill the petal apothecary; likewise the Crucible from Thaumcraft.
:task_complete: Crashes involving putting stacks into non-existent slots (causing an IndexOutOfBoundsException) should no longer happen with the Manifest. If it does I might cry.
:task_complete: The Brazier flame is now once again *animated* in addition to being fullbright. (Thanks to jaredlll08 with additional Vector Math by Aranai.)
:task_complete: Invalid/non-existent tiles are now properly culled from the tile list. This means that broken tiles may still draw tracking lines if you use the `/tiles` debug command, but opening and then closing the manifest before repeating the command should eliminate them.
:task_complete: JEI synchronisation enabled by the button should persist between opening and closing the manifest (but not between logging in and out).
:task_complete: The JEI search term that was in place when the manifest is opened is only restored to the JEI search bar if JEI synchronisation is currently enabled.
:task_complete: When using a keybind over an ingredient to search, only in-bounds, in-dimension and in-range items will be tracked. This means that if you are part of a hive and someone 10,000 blocks away has that item, tracking lines will no longer be drawn to it.
:task_complete: The chest name is now properly rendered in the GUI, meaning actual testing can commence to ensure that the new solution for chest names & items is robust. Again, you can left-click a chest with a debug orb (not in creative mode) to get information on it.
:task_complete: Tank capacity as an item now properly reflects the number of upgrades that it has. Rejoice!
:task_complete: Troves as an item no longer return a `null` ItemStack meaning things that scan the player's inventory will no longer cause a crash. (Specifically Building Gadgets).
:task_complete: Right-clicking any item into a trove (or double-right-clicking) will now result in an inventory refresh, meaning there should no longer be any ghost "in hand" copies of the item you just deposited. (***NOTE!!!*** This may still occur with some mods that perform "stack refresh" such as Inventory Tweaks and Quark; those are unfortunately not something I can fix).
:task_complete: Brazier weighting will no longer mistakenly consider chests with weights 0 and below "ignore" chests. Only chests with a weight of -1 specifically will be ignored. You can debug brazier-specific routing (in text & visual) with the `/brazier` command (listed in the Debugging section below).
:task_complete: Items and blocks are now properly registered within the context of the mod loading rather than when first accessed, meaning that your logs will no longer be spammed with "incorrect modid, got arcanearchives, expected XYZ instead" messages.
:task_complete: The Devouring Charm now properly and audibly munches items on the ground that you specify!
:task_complete: Automatic documentation for CraftTweaker support for the Gem Cutter's Table is now generated thanks to CodeTaylor's code (used with permission & compatible license). This documentation will be available on the CraftTweaker docs page after release.
:task_complete: The API is now "fully" documented in a way that I hope is explanatory rather than simply verbose. It is also "fully" tested although I am sure there are ways to break it that I did not expect or foresee; at this point in time, it only provides methods for adding, removing and replacing recipes in the Gem Cutter's Table.
:task_complete: The pick-up delay on items spawned by clicking on troves is now zero, meaning that you can pick them up instantly rather than having to wait around for them.
:task_complete: Troves are no longer made of wood and as such can no longer be used as furnace fuel.
:task_complete: Troves-as-items now function properly as inventories... hopefully!
:task_complete: Right-clicking anywhere no longer clears the Manifest search bar or the Radiant Chest name. Whoops!
:task_complete: Localised the amphora tooltip and updated it to longer look like a date.
:task_complete: Radiant amphora now show visually in the icon what fluid they're currently linked to.
:task_complete: The Brazier fire is once more glorious!
:task_complete: Brazier routing should now function properly: instead of attempting to keep track of every item, we now invalidate the tracking map associated with the inventory, which is only manually re-generated when it's queried. In combination with a caching system (with a limit of 1 second), this should allow for efficiency and accuracy.
:task_complete: Per the above, weights have now been completely adjusted and are still visible via `/brazier`. Invalid tiles are now discarded, and weights are anywhere from 0-100 (for inventories that don't contain the item), 300-1500 (for inventories that do contain the items), 4000-4700 for troves, and up to 5000 to compensate for GCT weights.
:task_complete: Arcane Arsenal is now disabled by default.
:task_complete: The Brazier of Hoarding now uses the original animated fire texture and model. If this does not animate for you, and you have VanillaFix installed, please disable VanillaFix's "Texture Optimisations".
:task_complete: Routing weights have been readjusted for a better outcome based on the amount of items in the chest, the amount of *this* item in the chest, and generally ignoring empty spaces.
:task_complete: The Arcane Arsenal module (and its gems) is disabled by default. You can enable it in configuration (requires restart). The documentation is also disabled unless the module is installed.
:task_complete: Invalid tile entities are now properly culled from the list, although perhaps not often enough.
:task_complete: There are now a number of debug statements printed to the debug log in order to trace chest name and display stack disappearance.
:task_complete: Fluids which have no flowing texture will now default to the still texture. Fluids with neither will not be rendered in Radiant Tanks.
:task_complete: A number of instances where markDirty and server-side synchronisations were not being triggered have been disabled.
:task_complete: Trove upgrades are now displayed in a more sane manner when targetting with the reticle.
:task_complete: The Monitoring Crystal can no longer be applied to radiant storage.
:task_complete: You can shift-click on the Manifest Search Bar to synchronise *from* JEI to it. In addition, with JEI synchronisation enabled, anything you type in the Manifest Search Box will be copied into the JEI search bar; additionally, once you close the manifest, your former JEI search term (if present) will be restored. 
:task_complete: It is now optional (and default false) for your search term persisting between opening and closing the manifest.
:task_complete: You can change the configuration of shift-clicking on Manifest entries, between tracking & closing and tracking & not closing.
:task_complete: You can now right click an item being tracked in the manifest to clear just that item.
:task_complete: The text in Manifest search boxes and Radiant Chest name boxes should now render with the correct colour regardless of what's being displayed.
:task_complete: The Brazier now supports Shulker Boxes: you can right-click a shulker box onto a brazier and the contents (rather than the box itself) will be stored. This functionality also applies to ***any item that implements an Inventory Handler capability***. This does ***not*** include (unfortunately) many popular backback mods, and unfortunately such support would have to be custom-written for each one.
:task_complete: JEI no longer considers the quick-crafting slots to be inventory slots in the Radiant Crafting Table, and will no longer try to copy ingredient items from them when using the "+" transfer-to-table button.
:task_complete: Newly created Radiant Crafting Tables now properly have a network assigned and aren't popped off.
:task_complete: Null/empty ingredients are disregarded for both the Gem Cutter's Table recipes and the FastCrafting recipes used for the Radiant Crafting Table. This means shaped recipes should now function properly.
:task_complete: Ingredients in the matrix (the inventory) of the crafting table are prioritised over the inventory when quick-crafting.
:task_complete: The recipe for Dhi-Bug's Orb of Debugging Bugs is now disabled by default.
:task_complete: Updated pt_BR.lang (thanks aycfes)
:task_complete: Pressing the previous page arrow in the GCT now loops around to the last page when pressed from the first page.
:task_complete: Integrated Crafting should now function properly with chests whose max stack size is greater than 64, bypassing a Forge-implemented limitation on the max stack size.
:task_complete: You can now use the Manifest Keybind while hovering over ingredients in the JEI Bookmarks tab to search.
:task_complete: Debug commands and functionality of the Dhi-Bug orb now require Creative Mode in addition to command permission level 2.
:task_complete: Some debug statements have been removed/commented out or limited to the debug log.
:task_complete: The brazier now properly ignores & also displays the vertical limits.
