***Known issues***
:task_complete: Arcane Archives now depends on Mystical Lib in addition to Baubles. They are included in the zip file.
:task_incomplete: The recipes for various Scepters and other items in JEI display "4" and "6" as quantities for items even though it is for standard crafting tables. (This is actually an issue in the recipe itself for some reason.)
:task_incomplete: Your Gem Cutter's Table ***will most likely self-destruct***, leaving itself on the ground and ejecting its inventory contents. You will need to place it down again and restore the contents for it to function properly.
:task_incomplete: ***Due to the new upgrade system for Troves and Tanks, it is likely and entirely possible that you will lose all upgrades that you have supplied. You will need to replace them with the new upgrades to regain your storage. This is an unavoidable side-effect of the new upgrade system and not one that can be easily coded around***. At least not one that I have the mental capacity to do right now, so we all must cope!

***Changes***
:task_complete: All GUIs now have "simple" texture variants. If you use them instead, know that I am judging you.
:task_complete: Parchtear maximum charges multiplied by 8.
:task_complete: Base storage of troves multiplied by 16. This also affects upgrades.
:task_complete: Dependencies have been dramatically improved on the back-end, and Thaumcraft Infusion stabilisers have been properly implemented.
:task_complete: The Tome of Arcana granted via crafting your first Resonator or breaking your first bookcase now has the correct NBT.
:task_complete: Items in the Gem Cutter's Table are now reported via the Manifest and are trackable, but are not stored to via the Brazier of Hoarding.
:task_complete: A typo that was preventing the max distance configuration for the Manifest from funcitoning has been fixed and now it will actually function again. 
:task_complete: The Devouring Charm will now properly return fluid containers when closing the window, and you will no longer be able to insert the Devouring Charm into itself.
:task_complete: Radiant Tanks and Radiant Troves now use a different system of upgrades, in three tiers: Matrix Brace will provide 2 levels of upgrade, Containment Field (for Tanks) and Material Interface (for Radiant Troves) will provide 3 levels of upgrade, while a Block of Shaped Radiant Quartz will provide 4 levels of upgrade. Upgrades are sequential: you will need to install the brace first, then the field/interface, etc.
:task_complete: Upgrades can be applied to and removed from Radiant Tanks and Radiant Troves by sneak-right-clicking with a Scepter of Manipulation, will open up an interface with the various slots. Optional upgrades can also be applied through this interface.
:task_complete: There is currently one optional upgrade for Tanks and Troves: the Devouring Charm will provide Voiding functionality. This functionality makes it so that items and fluids directly added to a Tank or Trove that already contains that item or fluid, and is at capacity, will be voided instead of rejected.
:task_complete: Comparator output for Radiant Chests is now accurate with the new capacity. Likewise for Radiant Tanks and Radiant Troves.
:task_complete: Textures and item & block models have been updated to make sure that they are all correctly positioned. 
:task_complete: Items piped into an empty trove will now set the trove to that item. This functionality has been tested and confirmed as functional using vanilla hoppers.
:task_complete: Breaking a trove not only returns the items contained in it, but also the upgrades that have been applied to it. Radiant Tank upgrades can only be removed with the Scepter of Manipulation.
:task_complete: We now have an API!

***Testing targets***
:task_bullet: Please find things that are broken.
