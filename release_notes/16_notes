***Known issues***
:task_complete: Arcane Archives now depends on Mystical Lib and EnderCore (the latter yet to be finalised) in addition to Baubles. They are included in the zip file.
:task_incomplete: Radiant Tanks when used as items will only ever transfer 16 buckets. Using a large tank will generally result it in being placed next to the other tank.
:task_incomplete: The Devouring Charm will now try to place fluid containers in the fluid slot, but may return them automatically to you. Closing the interface and opening your inventory should fix any desyncs.
:task_incomplete: You can currently no longer use the Scepter of Manipulation to remove upgrades from tanks & troves. A new interface to do this is coming.
:task_incomplete: The book granted from breaking a bookcase or crafting your first resonator may not function correctly as a Tome of Arcana (meaning that you cannot open it).
:task_incomplete: The recipes for various Scepters and other items in JEI display "4" and "6" as quantities for items even though it is for standard crafting tables. (This is actually an issue in the ***recipe itself*** for some reason.)

***Updates & Bug Fixes***
:task_complete: Radiant Amphorae work again! Until you break them for us.
:task_complete: New models for the slivers of Light!
:task_complete: The Brazier of Hoarding is now here and craftable and it actually works!
:task_complete: Many gem things that my Noob brain does not understand.
:task_complete: The Tome of Arcana recipe should now correctly reward a usable book.
:task_complete: The Gem Cutter's Table should now properly drain fluid containers.
:task_complete: You can now keybind a key to open the Gem Socket regardless of where it is on your person (or in your Bauble slots).
:task_complete: Thanks to Mangoose, we have imported the code from Nether Chest and applied it to Radiant Chests: these now stack up to 256 (4x) of an item. This value is configurable (up to 8x).
:task_complete: Monitoring Crystals should now be compatible with old-fashiong IInventories.
:task_complete: Tracking lines will no longer cause visual artefacts due to failing to turn off OpenGL flags, etc.

***Testing targets***
:task_bullet: Please break radiant amphorae.
:task_bullet: If you think that something is going horribly wrong with brazier item sorting, you can use the `/brazier` command with the item in your inventory to see a rough track (without positions) of which inventories it will try storing into.
:task_bullet: Please keep an eye out for any slowdowns when adding large amounts of items to/from Radiant Chests.

***Other***
:task_complete: We'd like to welcome abused_master to the team and applaud them for single-handedly wading through the quagmire that was the code I'd written for the Amphora and fixing it!
