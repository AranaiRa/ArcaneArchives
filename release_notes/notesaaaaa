***Known issues***
:task_complete: Arcane Archives now depends on Baubles.
:task_incomplete: Due to a fluid duping glitch (in addition to a myriad of other problems), the radiant amphora (previously radiant bucket) is disabled for this build. 
:task_incomplete: The HUD for gems from Arcane Arsenal does not currently, accurately display the charges for gems contained within a gem socked bauble. Charges are reduced, and checking the tooltip of the gem in the socket will manually update it.
:task_incomplete: There is currently no keybind for accessing the socket while it is equipped. 
:task_incomplete: The debug `/hive` command is currently still enabled. If you have issues with joint hive networks, please ensure that the output of this command lists who you would expect.
:task_incomplete: The elasticity of hive networks beyond a few members has yet to be tested, and there may be issues with manifest packet sizes for extremely large networks. 
:task_incomplete: Tracking information is not cleared when leaving (or being expelled from) a hive network. Tracking lines may be incorrect or misleading, but can be cleared by `Sneak-Right-Click` with the Manifest, or `Sneak-<Manifest Keybind>`.
:task_complete: Item rarities have been removed as they added a lot of clutter and confusion, and were not properly distributed according to available tiers.
:task_incomplete: A number of behind-the-scenes changes were made with registry names. These should be correctly translated by a mappings event when the mod is launched, but you may need to update scripts or other configuration settings to reflect the new names.
:task_incomplete: Comparator outputs are available but incorrectly calculated and always reporting a value of 15 for Radiant Troves and Radiant Tanks.
:task_incomplete: Some recipes incorrectly display the number of required sticks as "4" and the number of required gold nuggets as "6" in JEI. This may be limited to our dev environments, or may be an interaction with another mod, or may be an outdated version of JEI on our part.
:task_incomplete: Translocators currently do not wish to insert items into Radiant Troves, although vanilla hoppers seem to function perfectly. A full appraisal of all insertion methods will be made before beta release.
:task_incomplete: Slivers of Light can support other Slivers of Light.
:task_incomplete: There are a number of visual issues including but not limited to:
- The Gem Casting HUD being visible causes the hot bar slots to darken.
- The line renderer jitters slightly due to not functioning on frames.
- The renderer for the Radiant Tank will sometimes display strange lighting issues in the world.
- (In dev environments in particular), Radiant Tanks with contained fluids as items will cause issues with the light position in containers.

***Changes***
:task_complete: Massive updates to networks now allows for players to join together, sharing manifest information (with more sharing to come in the future).
:task_complete: You can now craft a "Letter of Invitation" to invite someone to your network. If neither of you are in a network, this will create one. This process happens behind the scenes and has no impact on gameplay.
:task_complete: You can now craft a "Letter of Resignation" to leave your current network. If you are the owner of the network, ownership will transfer to the next oldest member. If someone leaving a network means it would only have one member (the owner), then it reverts back to a normal network.
:task_complete: You can now craft a "Writ of Expulsion" which allows the owner of a network to name the writ in an anvil and then use it to specifically remove a player from their network.
:task_complete: Crafting these items in a Gem Cutter's Table requires the correct permission. i.e., only the network owner can craft a "Writ of Expulsion" or a "Letter of Invitation", but any member can craft a "Letter of Resignation". These permissions are synchronised when opening the Gem Cutter's Table GUI for the first time: if someone accepts an invitation and a network is created while you are in the interface, you will need to leave the interface and re-enter it to gain access to other recipes.
:task_complete: Joining or leaving a network sends a message to all members currently online that someone has joined/parted.
:task_complete: Hive networks retain the independence of their members. Any chests that you place down and use will be part of your network, and will remain yours if you were to leave (or be removed from) a network.
:task_complete: While there is currently no easy way to determine from a manifest whether items are stored in your chests or not, in the event of players joining up together over long distances and not wishing tracking lines to go to infinity, you can now configure the "maximum distance" for tracking in the configuration.
:task_complete: There is now a "configuration" icon on the manifest (next to the refresh button). Clicking this will automatically bring up the Arcane Archives config; you can then go into Manifest Settings and change the "maximum distance" value to whatever you choose.
:task_complete: The effects of "maximum distance" mean that, similarly to how items in other dimensions were displayed separately, items that are out of your maximum range will be displayed as a separate, slightly-dimmed icon. It is still possible to track these.
:task_complete: Manifest item scrolling is now a thing! A flexible system allows you to view the entire contents of your network, no matter how large it is. In addition to the scroll bar, you can also use up/down/PGUP/PGDWN to navigate.
:task_complete: Radiant Quartz Clusters have a new, more appropriately forbiddenly shaped model and have facing. You can harvest these with silk touch if you wish to use them for decorative purposes. They can be converted back into Radiant Quartz simply by crafting them shapelessly.
:task_complete: The Gem Cutter's Table should no longer cause a crash when you break it via the accessor, and it should no longer instantly break.
:task_complete: The Radiant Crafting Table will now drop its contents when broken instead of sending them into the void. Oops!
:task_complete: The Radiant Chest background texture is now less rainbow :( but this means that it's easier to tell what some items are and they do not become obscured by the background.
:task_complete: The Scepter of Revelation now supports Radiant Tanks.
:task_complete: Rotating tile entities (specifically Radiant Troves) will no longer cause them to become invalid and "pop off".
:task_complete: Banging your hand against a wall is no longer an aimless task! If you hold Radiant Quartz, you have a chance to create Radiant Slivers of Light instead. These act as a torch which can be placed on any surface (even vertically).
:task_complete: Gem Cutter's Table recipes which require buckets of water or lava will now return empty buckets. While CraftTweaker integration will allow you to add recipes using other types of fluid containers, these are currently special-cased to buckets. In future this will change to a more generic and reliable method.
:task_complete: Radiant Lantern bounding boxes are now correct.
:task_complete: The Gem Cutter's Table recipes (when hovered over) now display all variants of an ore dictionary item that are acceptable, rather than just the first item. This should lead to less confusion when checking recipes.
:task_complete: Back-end-wise, there has been a proper separation of the maintained fork of Guidebook for Arcane Archives purposes, which changes that have been made being PR'd back into the main branch. 
:task_complete: The Manifest Lectern has been added. It is simple to craft (in a crafting table), and you can right click it to access your own manifest. At this point in time you cannot access anyone else's. However, both blocks (as it is technically a "multiblock" structure) will allow you to access the manifest.
:task_complete: The Gem Cutter's Table and the Manifest Lectern now properly give off light.
:task_complete: Tracking line renderers are now more colourful.
:task_complete: Manifest slots now use a custom renderer to display the quantity of items per slot, making for a more pleasant "3K" instead of "3000" that overlaps into other cells.
:task_complete: Cats now find Radiant Resonators irresistible, much as they do chests. Much to their delight (or dismay), they may find the upward impetus of rapid crystal growth a little more uplifting than expected.
:task_complete: Converting a normal vanilla chest (or Quark equivalent) to a Radiant Chest will no longer cause potential issues with adjacent chests of other varieties, and should no longer cause networking errors or errors where your inventory is replaced. ***If these continue, please report them.***
:task_complete: In the odd event that you might have all of your items "dimmed" in the Manifest, the screen will no longer go black.
:task_complete: Gem Cutter's Table recipes now correctly display their stack size in JEI.
:task_complete: Tanks no longer "lose" capacity if you upgrade them and then break & re-place them before inserting a fluid. Oops!
:task_complete: You can now toggle slot highlighting ***for non-Arcane Archives mod containers***. Slot highlighting will still happen in Radiant Chests, but if you don't wish it to appear in vanilla or other mod containers, you can turn it off in the configuration.
:task_complete: Double-right-click on a trove should now correctly insert all matching items into the trove every time, instead of randomly failing sometimes.
:task_complete: Radiant Troves (and Tanks) should no longer care about what hand the upgrade is in, or what you have in your other hand, when attempting to upgrade them.
:task_complete: Radiant Chests now give an accurate value when used with a comparator.
:task_complete: WAILA and TOP now report the item and quantity contained within a Radiant Trove.
:task_complete: All items have had their registry names shortened, and all component items have had their registry names shortened even more. The raw quartz cluster is now distinct from raw quartz (as it is now an obtainable item). All instances of "cut" quartz have been replaced with shaped.
:task_complete: Radiant Resonators will no longer "pop off" if you go a distance away from them and then return. This only affected players using version preview14.
:task_complete: It's no longer possible to duplicate items from the Gem Cutter's Table output slot using the Mouse Tweaks "scroll wheel" utility. Indeed, this utility has been disabled as a whole for the entire screen: once I work out how to specifically restrict it to the output slot, the functionality will return.
:task_complete: The Gem Cutter's Table now has CraftTweaker compatibility! `mods.arcanearchives.GCT.removeRecipe(IItemStack output)` allows you to remove recipes, and `mods.arcanearchives.GCT.addRecipe(String name, IItemStack output, IIngredient[] inputs)` will allow you to add new recipes.
:task_complete: It's not possible to access any of the Gem Cutter's Table recipe conditions through the CraftTweaker compatibility. It is also entirely untested. Oops.
:task_complete: You will now receive a Tome of Arcane the first time you break a book case or craft a radiant resonator, although manually crafting the tome (with a book and a gold nugget) will bypass this process. This ~~will~~ should only happen once per game.

***Gems***
:task_complete: There is now a new module named "Arcane Arsenal". While this is currently a module of the main mod, these items will be split off into their own add-on mod at some point in the future. ***You may completely disable the crafting recipes of these items as well as their appearance in JEI and creative tabs through the configuration. This requires a restart.***.
:task_complete: You can craft a number of gems, including the rivertear (which places water where you point it over a distance), and the mountaintear (which does the same but with lava).
:task_complete: Gems feature a HUD which allows you to see the type of gem currently being held, and how many charges remain. A gem socket bauble can be crafted to store a single gem (which is considered held), although there are currently visual issues in synchronising charges.
:task_complete: Rivertears can be recharged by throwing them into water; likewise Mountaintears can be recharged by throwing them into lava. These methods may change in future.
:task_complete: There is a colourblind accessibility feature for the Arsenal module which can be toggled without restarting the game. This places a letter over the gem to denote its colour.
:task_complete: The myriad of other gems available can be found documented in the Tome of Arcana.
:task_complete: You can now utilise a Scepter of Manipulation in one hand and an item (or block) in another to "set" that item to display on the selected face of a Radiant Chest. Sneak-Right-Click with the Scepter of Manipulation to clear it. Valid faces are: east, north, south, west.


***Testing targets***
:task_bullet: Test the elasticity of hive networks, large and small! Greater inventory sizes will lead to larger packet sizes, and there is the potential for reaching the hard limits set on those.
:task_bullet: Test and play around with joining and leaving multiple networks. Do items from your previous network stick around on your manifest, or are new ones not showing up properly?

***Work in Progress***
:task_incomplete: Work is still in progress on a number of gem fronts.
:task_incomplete: The Brazier of Holding is still in progress, but an easily-searchable inventory of items is being maintained server-side in order to make the process of using the Brazier fast and lag-free.
:task_incomplete: Upgrade systems for Radiant Troves and Radiant Tanks will now be in three stages (although the quantity stored will remain the same). In addition, upgrades for voiding excess items, automatically converting items based on ore dictionary entry, or converting based on Chisel (if Chisel is installed) type will be available.
:task_incomplete: The Radiant Amphora is currently being thrashed for having too many issues to go live.
:task_incomplete: The Radiant Crafting Table's lonely 3 "favourite recipe" slots will function to attempt to place the items required to craft those recipes into the crafting grid.
:task_incomplete: Thanks to the developer of Nether Chest, who has graciously allowed us to use and even copy some of their code, the stack sizes of the Radiant Chest will increase before the 0.2.0 beta release.
